# Workflow to calculate ANIr and sequence coverage (depth and breadth) of genomes / MAGs from metagenomes by gene, contig, and whole genome.

This workflow produces separate files in tab separated value (tsv) format for ANIr, sequence depth, and sequence breadth for the genes and contigs of a genome / MAG in fasta format. It also produces a file containing sequence depth at each position as well as a file with results calculated for the whole genome sequence. tsv files can be easily opened in Excel, or imported into Python with Pandas or read into R for further analysis. There is also an option to generate some summary plots.
